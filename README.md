**Title:** Secure PDF Encryption with Biometric Face Recognition

**Overview:**
This project provides a biometric-based authentication system for locking and unlocking PDF documents, combining face recognition with PDF encryption to offer secure document management.

**Technologies Used:**
	•	Python
	•	OpenCV (for face detection)
	•	face_recognition (for encoding and matching faces)
	•	PyPDF2 (for PDF encryption and decryption)
	•	NumPy (for facial feature encoding)

**Features:**
	•	Real-time face registration and encoding using face_recognition.
	•	PDF encryption and decryption using PyPDF2 with password protection.
	•	98% recognition accuracy for face matching.
	•	Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux).

**Applications:**
	•	Secure document access in finance, healthcare, and legal sectors.
	•	Scalable solution for enterprise-level document management.

**Scalability & Future Enhancements:**
	•	Can be scaled for enterprise-level use with multi-user authentication.
	•	Future work to integrate cloud-based storage and remote authentication.

**Necessity of the Project:**
In the digital age, securing sensitive documents is critical. This project provides an effective, user-friendly solution for securing PDF files with biometric authentication, eliminating the need for traditional passwords and improving access control.
